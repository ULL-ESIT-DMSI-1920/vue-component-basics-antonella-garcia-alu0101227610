# Vue.js Components Basics

This repository is dedicated to the development of the project Component Basics, following the steps provided by the teacher and the Vue Fundamentals School.

## Click Counter Task 

### Check List

- [x]  All along, use as many [emmet expressions](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) as you can to speed up the edition
- [x] Set the initial HTML and load Vue from the CDN
- [x] Inside the app create the Vue app attached to the corresponding div element 
- [x] Create a component `click-counter` using `Vue.component`
  - [x] Add the `data` function that returns the object with the data. 
  - [x] Set the `count`
  - [x] In the template add the `v-on` to increase the counter each time the button is clicked
- [x] Add in the `app` div of the HTML the component just created
- [x] Insert new instances of the component in the HTML
- [x] Move the template from the `app.js` to the HTML using  a `script` tag
- [x]  Instead of `<script type= 'text/x-template' ...>` try also to use the [`<template>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) HTML tag. 
  Does it work? 

* No it does not work, working with templates and scripts is quite tricky in vue and html, everything i looked up on the internet was reffered to the work already done.

- [x] Add a second element, a paragraph `the count is` to the `click-counter` component 
- [x] Wrap the two elements in a `<div>`
- [x] Move all the code from `app.js` to the HTML `index.html` 
- [x] Add a `prop` with name `click-title` to the `click-counter` component so that instead of the fixed `"the count is"`, the parent component can specify the prefix paragraph:

  ```html
    <click-counter click-title="The first counter is:"></click-counter>
    <click-counter click-title="The second counter is:"></click-counter>
    <click-counter click-title="The Third counter is:"></click-counter>
  ```
  Read the section [Prop Casing (camelCase vs kebab-case)](https://crguezl.github.io/learning-vue-geting-started-guide/#prop-casing-camelcase-vs-kebab-case)
  of the *Annotated Reading of the Essentials Section of the Vue.js Guide*

  Leave your solution inside the files `index.html` and `app.js`.

* I left the solution in the file Index.html, since there was a step required to copy all the content of app.js to index.html

## Plan Picker Task

In this exercise you have to start from a HTML file that contains  repeated ` <div class="plan">` like

```html
      <div class="plans">
        <div class="plan">
          <div class="description">
            <span class="title">
              The Single
            </span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="plan">
          <div class="description">
            <span class="title">
              The Addict
            </span>
          </div>
        </div>
       ...
      </div>  
```

and you have to factorize the code introducing a Vue.js component `<plan>`

Files [plan-picker/solution.html](plan-picker/solution.html) and [plan-picker/solution-app.js](plan-picker/solution-app.js) contain the final solution.

### Check List 

#### [Reusable Components with Props](https://vueschool.io/lessons/reusable-components-with-props)
  
- [x]  Use a minimum number of emmet expressions to generate complete the initial `index.html` to have it as at the beginning of the video [Reusable Components with Props](https://vueschool.io/lessons/reusable-components-with-props). The structure to replicate three or four times has to follow this pattern:
  
  ```html
        <div class="plans">
            <div class="plan">
                <div class="description">
                    <span class="title">
                    The Single
                    </span>
                </div>
            </div>
            ...  more like the one above
        </div>
  ```
  - [x] Here is a [solution](plan-picker/solution.emmet)
- [x] Load Vue from the CDN and add the main app
- [x] Create the `plan` component that encapsulates the template above
- [x] Add it the `prop` with the `name`, interpolate it inside the component template and update the calls in the HTML accordingly for all the repetitions
- [x] Add to the Vue app data the `plans` array of Strings with the names of the plans
- [x] Substitute the repetitions of the `<plan>` component  inside  the HTML for a `v-for` loop
- [x] Specify that the `prop` `name` has to be of type `String` and is `required`


#### [Nested Components](https://vueschool.io/lessons/nested-components) Video

- [x] Create a component with name `<plan-picker>`  to encapsulate the `.plans` div
- [x] Create the template for the component and move the `plans` array into the component

#### [Global vs Local Components](https://vueschool.io/lessons/global-vs-local-components)

- [x] Make the `plan` component local to the `plan-picker` component
  - [x] Check that a local component can not be used out of its scope
- [x] Make the `plan-picker` component local to the root component
  - [x] Register first the component with the name `planPicker` and try to use it. What happens?
  - [x] Change the name to `plan-picker`


#### [Communication Between Components with Custom Events](https://vueschool.io/lessons/communication-between-components) Video

We want to add the capability to select a plan. See how the 
[solution](https://crguezl.github.io/vuejs-components-basics-plan-picker-component/plan-picker/solution.html) works when you click in one of the plans. We want to reproduce this behavior,

- [x] Add a boolean variable `selected` to the `plan` component
- [x] Add a `select` method to the  `plan` component to set the component as selected
- [x] Add the code so that when a user clicks **on the root element** of the `plan` component template the `select` method is called
  - [x] See [Event Handling](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/events.html) and [Component Custom Events](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-custom-events.html) in the Vue.js Guide
  - [x] What happens if you add the code for the click on **an element inside** the `plan` component?
  * We would have to use an event modifier.
- [x] Using the object syntax for `v-bind` add a class `active-plan` when a `plan` component is selected so that the background color of the button changes when selected, since the `style.css` contains the following:

  ```css 
  .plans .active-plan {
    border-color: #352001;
    background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom right, white, #8F4401);
  }
  ```
  See [Class and Style Bindings](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/class-and-style.html) in the Vue.js Guide
- [x] Verify that, unfortunately, the solution given permits several plans to be selected
- [x] We need to let the component communicate to its parent when the user has clicked on it. 
      Make the `plan` component to `$emit` an event with name `select` and payload the `name`of the plan
  - [x] Read the notes on the api of [vm.$emit( eventName, [???args] )](https://crguezl.github.io/learning-vue-geting-started-guide/#vm.emit-eventname-args)
- [x] Check in the event tab of the Vue DevTools the presence of the events generated when you click
- [x] Inside the `plan-picker` component template set  the triggering of a method `selectPlan` to fire when the `select`  event is emitted. 
- [x] Inside the `plan-picker` component add a data attribute `selectedPlan` to store the plan that was selected by the user
- [x] Add also the code for the `selectPlan` method
- [x] The idea is now that the parent `plan-picker`  component will send the selected plan as a property to the children components.
  
  Go back to the `plan` component and remove the `selected` data property (it is no longer need, since the parent component now knows which plan has been selected)
- [x] Add a property `selectedPlan` to the `plan` component (that will be passed by the parent)
- [x] Add a *computed property* `isSelected` to the `plan` component that is `true` when the plan is the one selected
- [x] In the template of the `plan` component conditionally bind the class `active-plan` to the `.plan` div  if the plan is selected
- [x] Inside the `plan-picker-template` pass the property `selectedPlan` to the children.
  - [x] Be carefull that HTML attributes are case insensitive but the name of the `plan` attribute we choose inside the JavaScript code was `selectedPlan` (*CamelCase*) and so to write `v-bind:selectedPlan="..."` is not going to work. You have to use the equivalent *kebab-case* string
